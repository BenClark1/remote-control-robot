# Remote Control Robot
This program is for controlling the robot using the Arduino infrared remote controller. This allowed me to learn C++ techniques such as switch statements.

I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so please [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/remote-control-robot/issues). Your input is much appreciated.

### Prerequisites
You'll need Arduino hardware and the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
